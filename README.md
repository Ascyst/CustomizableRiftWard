# CustomizableRiftWard

This mod was created just to see if I could.

Allows you to configure Rift Ward effective range, as well as the success chance for blocking rifts (by default, range is 30 units and there is a 95% chance to block.).


Config isn't live, requires a restart between changes.

You can find the config under: %AppData%\VintagestoryData\ModConfig\CustomizableRiftWard.json

riftBlockChance: requires value between 0 and 1 (e.g, 0.95 is the default 95% block chance)
maxRange: theoretically unlimited I guess? must be a whole number between 1 and 340 decillion, i think that's the float max.


I've got shakey experience with coding and this was an almost fully blind attempt to create something without tutorials. I was unable to properly test this to verify if the radius/success chance is actually increased, but the code works, doesn't throw harmony errors, and the ward still works ingame so I'm assuming it must work.

If you have any issues with this mod, please comment and I will look into it.
